# Save-Turtle-Prediction

A simple MATLAB program to save the turtle population bytaking user input for the number of years to project in future.


# Discussion

On observing the graph of save_hatchlings, it can be seen that by making all the hatchlings survive to the youth age helps increasing the population of youth loggerhead turtles till the initial 2 years after which there is a gradual decline in the population of youths. In addition to this, the hatchling population gradually declines over the period of 50 years but the rate of decline in hatchlings is lower than that of youth loggerhead turtles.

On the other hand, decreasing the death rate of youth loggerhead turtles and increasing their numbers to breed into adult stages decreases the population of youth for the initial 4 years but a gradual increment procures the population to increase for the next 46 years. The population of hatchlings in this case declines for the initial year but climbs up for the following years of projection.

Therefore, it is evident from the observation of both graphs that reducing the death rates of youth and increasing their numbers to breed into adult stage is an efficient management strategy to help reversing the population decline of loggerhead turtles.
